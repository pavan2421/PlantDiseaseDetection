ðŸŒ± Plant Disease Detection using Deep Learning
ðŸ“Œ Introduction

Farmers lose a significant portion of their crop yield every year due to late or incorrect identification of plant diseases, which impacts both food security and income. Manual inspection is slow, error-prone, and often unavailable in rural areas, while excessive pesticide use damages soil, water, and the environment. To address these issues, we propose a deep learning-based solution that can automatically detect plant diseases from leaf images and assist farmers with timely, accurate, and sustainable crop protection.

ðŸšœ Challenges in Traditional Disease Detection

Manual inspection is time-consuming, subjective, and often inaccurate.

Pesticide misuse causes soil degradation, water pollution, and biodiversity loss.

Lack of expert access in rural areas delays diagnosis and treatment.

Large-scale farming makes plant-by-plant inspection impractical.

Climate variations accelerate the spread of diseases.

ðŸ¤– Proposed Solution

A Deep Learning-based approach using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):

Automatically identifies diseases from leaf images with minimal human input.

Works across multiple crops and disease categories using diverse datasets.

Fast, reliable, and scalable, supporting real-time predictions for farmers.

Deployable on mobile phones, IoT devices, or drones, enabling easy access even in remote areas.

Promotes sustainability by reducing pesticide misuse and improving crop health.

âœ… Results & Key Highlights
